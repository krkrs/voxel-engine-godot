# voxel-engine-godot - Decemver 2021
Basic implementation of voxel type game in Godot.
For testing use [Godot 4.0 beta8 mono](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.0-beta8). This version allows for access to mesh generating function from child process. It is unsafe and I used it as this project is experimental and old.
